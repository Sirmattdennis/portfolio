Code files, images, links, and anything else I have to share

"ctc" Images:
	My currently ongoing task is a complete redesign of the Connection Technology Center website. No small task, considering I am the sole web dev dedicated to it. A single PSD containing three page layouts suitable for exactly 1300px wide browser windows was the entirety of what I had to go on, design-wise. The old outdated design is still active at www.ctconline.com, so until the new one is finalized, I can only provide page screenshots.

"Everwilde" Images:
	A small website built to showcase an inn and spa project proposal. Nothing too out of the ordinary here, but I only had a total of two work days to design and build the site. www.everwildeinnandspa.com

Eagle Productivity Solutions:
	As part of the team of interactive developers, I helped to create interactive learning tools for clients primarily in the field of pharmaceuticals. Projects included e-learning courses, to e-blasts, software simulations, and more. As much of the work is built for private use, I can only share samples from Eagle's public "Portfolio" page. www.eagleproductivity.com/interactive.html

A Skewed Paradise Comics:
	Running from 2007-2010, A Skewed Paradise was a webcomic and personal website. While it is now a bit dated in both design and tech, it was a long-running learning experience in designing, building, and maintaining a website. It peaked at around 10,000 readers, and had an active forum with about 50,000 total posts. It utilized Drupal as its CMS, and all art is indeed mine.
