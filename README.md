Code files, images, links, and anything else I have to share

### "CTC" Images:
My currently ongoing task is a complete redesign of the Connection Technology Center website. 
No simple challenge, considering I am the sole web dev dedicated to it. Design-wise, 
the entirety of what I had to go on was a single PSD containing three page layouts for a browser 
of exactly 1300px wide, and the instruction to "make sure it's responsive". 
The old outdated design is still active, so until the new one is finalized, 
I can only provide page screenshots. These screenshots show the responsiveness of the design, 
displaying a page in narrow, medium, and wide browsers. More can be taken and provided upon request.

### "Everwilde" Images:
	A small website built to showcase an inn and spa project proposal. Nothing too out of the ordinary here, but I only had a total of two work days to design and build the site.

### Eagle Productivity Solutions:
	As part of the team of interactive developers, I helped to create interactive learning tools for clients primarily in the field of pharmaceuticals. Projects included e-learning courses, to e-blasts, software simulations, and more. As much of the work is built for private use, I can only share samples from Eagle's public "Portfolio" page.

### A Skewed Paradise Comics:
	Running from 2007-2010, A Skewed Paradise was a webcomic and personal website. While it is now a bit dated in both design and tech, it was a long-running learning experience in designing, building, and maintaining a website. Over the years, it had gone through new designs, thanks to improving knowledge, hosting changes, and new technologies. It peaked at around 10,000 readers, and had an active forum with about 50,000 total posts. It utilized Drupal as its CMS, and all art within ASP is indeed mine.

### "Damage Calculator":
	An old little project I built with a single html/js file and some images. Code-wise, nothing particularly out of the ordinary, but even to this day, it's fun to play around with the many values, buttons, and options, to see what kinds of results you can get. I later on converted this concept into C# and created a Windows Forms app with more UI features, updated images, and tweaked calculations.
