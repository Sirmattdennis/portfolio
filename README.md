Code files, images, links, and anything else I have to share

#### Eagle Productivity Solutions:
As part of the team of interactive developers, I helped to create interactive learning tools 
for clients primarily in the field of pharmaceuticals. Projects included e-learning courses, 
to e-blasts, software simulations, and more. As much of the work is built for private use, 
I can only share samples from Eagle's public "Portfolio" page.

#### Images Folder ####
A few samples of more artistically driven projects.

asp162: One of the last pages from my now discontinued webcomic.

aspcast: A cast shot of my old webcomic.
The first thing I made when I received and set up my Cintiq.

concept_jack_colors: A set of character concept art for a friend, with several color sets.

ctc images: See below this list.

eaglehands: A sample of drawn hands that we would occasionally use at Eagle
in eLearning courses to show tapping a device, as an alternative to a cropped photo of a hand.

everw images: See below this list.

happytrees: A series of images showing a template I had created for quickly creating detailed,
unique trees to be used in backgrounds of drawn projects. The third image shows three trees
that were assembled in about a minute each. Ideally these look best as background elements, not
shown extremely close.

image_briermisk: A quick sketch-up of a creature for a campaign.

py2d images: -anim is a short intro animation made for a YouTube channel in Flash and exported to mp4.
The mp4 does not have the dithering that this gif shows. The -pixel file is a logo for the same
channel, given a pixelated retro look.

welwynd_v4: A map made from scratch for a tabletop RPG campaign.

wip-lineart: There's something wonderful about clean lineart from a sketch,
before colors get added.

wyrid: A spooky thing, in a spooky place, holding a spooky stick.

#### "CTC" Images:
My ongoing task was a complete redesign of the Connection Technology Center website. 
No simple challenge, considering I was the sole web dev dedicated to it. Design-wise, 
the entirety of what I had to go on was a single PSD containing three page layouts for a browser 
of exactly 1300px wide, and the instruction to "make sure it's responsive". 
These screenshots show the responsiveness of the design, 
displaying a page in narrow, medium, and wide browsers. Visit the company website to see the
final result.

#### "Everwilde" Images:
A small website built to showcase an inn and spa project proposal. 
Nothing too out of the ordinary here, but I only had a total of two work days to design and build the site.

#### A Skewed Paradise Comics:
Running from 2007-2010, A Skewed Paradise was a webcomic and personal website. 
While it is now a bit dated in both design and tech, it was a long-running 
learning experience in designing, building, and maintaining a website. 
Over the years, it had gone through new designs, thanks to improving knowledge, 
hosting changes, and new technologies. It peaked at around 10,000 readers, 
and had an active forum with about 50,000 total posts. 
It utilized Drupal as its CMS, and all art within ASP is indeed mine.

#### "Damage Calculator":
An old little project I built with a single html/js file and some images. 
Code-wise, nothing particularly out of the ordinary, but even to this day, 
it's fun to play around with the many values, buttons, and options, 
to see what kinds of results you can get. I later on converted this concept into C# 
and created a Windows Forms app with more UI features, updated images, and tweaked calculations.
